# openflowj-demo retired

OpenFlow 1.3 support has been integrated into [loxigen](https://github.com/floodlight/loxigen).
You can find the generated artifacts in the [loxigen-artifacts repository] (https://github.com/floodlight/loxigen-artifacts).
This demo is thus retired.

You can explicitly check out the archive branch if you're interested in the demo for historic purposes.
